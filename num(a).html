      • The greatest five-digit number is 99999. When we add 1 to this five-digit number, we get 1,00,000,

	  six-digit number. The number, that is, one with five zeroes (100000), is called one lakh.</br></br>

	The estimation of a number is a reasonable guess of the actual value. Estimation means approximating a quantity
 to the accuracy required. This is done by rounding off the numbers involved and getting a quick, rough answer.

The numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 are nearer to 0. So, these numbers are rounded off to the lower ten.
 The numbers 6, 7, 8 and 9 are nearer to 10. So, these numbers are rounded off to the higher ten. 
 The number 5 is equidistant from both 0 and 10, so it is rounded off to the higher ten.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(i) We round off 31 to the nearest ten as 30.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(ii) We round off 57 to the nearest ten as 60.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(iii) We round off 45 to the nearest ten as 50 The numbers 1 to 49 are closer to 0. So, these numbers are 
rounded off to the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnearest hundred.<br>

 (iv) We round off 578 to the nearest 100 as 600.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
