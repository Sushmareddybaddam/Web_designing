			   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			   The set of whole numbers include the natural numbers and 0. Call this set W, then </br>
			   W = { 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,......}.


			  Natural number, also called counting numbers, are 1, 2, 3, 4...

				Just so you know, there are other types of numbers.

			These are integers, rational numbers, irrational numbers real numbers, and complex numbers.

			We will not cover these here, we will only focus on whole numbers in this unit, 
			but be aware that they exist.</br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			Everybody counts, add or subtract on a daily basis from the time we started counting toys on the 
			floor when we were 2 or 3 years old to when we count the cost of our groceries.
			When we count, we use a number to represent a quantity. A number is an idea that we use to represent
			that quantity.

			We write the numbers down using symbols and these are called numerals.

			The numeral that we use to represent the set above is   4.

			When using numbers to count how many elements a set has, it is referred to as cardinal numbers.</br>
              &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			For instance, 4 or four is a cardinal number.

			Besides counting how many elements a set has, we use numbers to order objects.</br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			Our team is second in group A.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			I am fifty-sixth in line.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			The first president of the United States is George Washington.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			Numbers used in this way are called ordinal numbers.

			For example, first, second, and fifty-sixth are ordinal numbers.

			For cardinal numbers, we can use the symbol n(A) to represent the number of elements in a finite 
			set A.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			For example, the set made of cubes has 4 elements. We can write n(cubes) = 4.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			If A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, n(A) = 6.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			If B = {♠,♠,♠,♠,♠,♠,♠,♠,♠} n(B) = 9.</br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			Let's say you have 4 blocks, 8 flats, 5 longs, and 8 cubes. </br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

				What number is this?</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				1 block represents 1000, so 4 blocks represent 4000.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				1 flat represents 100, so 8 flats represent 800.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				1 long represents 10, so 5 longs represent 50.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				1 cube represents 1, so 8 cubes represent 8.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				4000 + 800 + 50 + 8 = 4858.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				Knowing about operations with numbers can be an invaluable tool as we go about our daily routine.

				My goal is to help you discover the similarities among addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
				and division.

				Before knowing how to add, subtract, multiply and so forth, it is important to understand 
				place value.
