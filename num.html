		Counting things is easy for us now. We can count objects in large numbers, for example, 
		the number of students in the school, and represent them through numerals. We can also 
		communicate large numbers using suitable number names. </br></br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		
		It is not as if we always knew how 
		to convey large quantities in conversation or through symbols. Many thousands years ago, 
		people knew only small numbers. Gradually, they learnt how to handle larger numbers. They 
		also learnt how to express large numbers in symbols. All this came through collective efforts 
		of human beings. Their path was not easy, they struggled all along the way. In fact, the 
		development of whole of Mathematics can be understood this way. As human beings progressed, 
		there was greater need for development of Mathematics and as a result Mathematics grew further 
		and faster.</br></br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp		
		We use numbers and know many things about them. Numbers help us count concrete 
		objects. They help us to say which collection of objects is bigger and arrange them in order 
		e.g., first, second, etc. Numbers are used in many different contexts and in many ways. Think 
		about various situations where we use numbers. List five distinct situations in which numbers 
		are used.</br></br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		We enjoyed working with numbers in our previous classes. We have added, subtracted, 
		multiplied and divided them. We also looked for patterns in number sequences and done many 
		other interesting things with numbers. In this chapter, we shall move forward on such interesting
		things with a bit of review and revision as well.

		<h3 id="he">Comparing numbers</h3>
		<p id="pa">Let us see how to find out the largest and smallest numbers among given list of numbers.
		</br>
		Steps to be followed:</br></br>
		1.Find out the number of digits in each number and compare those.The number which has more
		number of digits is the greatest and which has least number of digits is the smallest.</br></br>
		2.If the numbers have same number of digits then compare the digits in left most place
		of the number.For example,if the number has 4 digits in it,then compare the thousands place
		of all the numbers.The number which has greatest number in its left most place is the large
		number and quite opposite goes with smallest number.</br></br>
		3.Now,if the digit in first left most place is also the same, then go on comparing digits from 
		left to right.</br></br>
		This is the way to figure out the largest and smallest numbers among given list of numbers.
		</br></br>
		Example:</br></br>
		a.Find out the largest and smallest numbers among  92, 392, 4456, 89742.</br>
		ans:No. of digits in 92 - 2</br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNo. of digits in 392 - 3</br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNo. of digits in 4456 - 4</br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNo. of digits in 89742 - 5</br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			Therefore,the largest number is 89742 and smallest is 92.</br></br>
		
		b.Find out the largest and smallest numbers among 75,489,3484,3472.</br>
		ans:No. of digits in 75 - 2</br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNo. of digits in 489 - 3</br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNo. of digits in 3484 - 4</br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNo. of digits in 3472 - 4</br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			Here,we have two numbers with same number of digits.So,compare the digits from left to right.
			Both the numbers 3484 and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3472 have same numbers in their thousands place and hundreds place.
			The digits in tens place in numbers 3484 and 3472 are &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp8 and 7 respectively.Therefore,3484 is
			the largest and 75 is the smallest among given four numbers.</br></br>

			  <h3 id="hea">How many numbers can you make?</h3>
			  <p id="para">Suppose, we have four digits 7, 8, 3, 5. Using these digits we want to make different 
			  4-digit numbers such that no digits are repeated in a number. Thus, 7835 is allowed, but
			  7735 is not. Make as many 4-digit numbers as you can. </br>
			  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			  Which is the greatest number you
			  can get? Which is the smallest number? </br>
			  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			  The greatest number is 8753 and the smallest is 
			  3578. </p>
